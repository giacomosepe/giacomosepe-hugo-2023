Living like Google does't really mean much I know.
So let me explain.
Google started as a fun venture of three friends. We all know the story. They found what today we call product market fit while building their products. They never pursued it. Steve Jobs, 30 years earlier did more or less the same: _"I like computers, I know everything about computers, but I need to make money... so... let me think... who will buy pieces of computers that me and my friend Woz can build? computer stores, of course! let's talk to them... ah they want full computers?! not parts of them, ok for money we will do that"._  
I can imagine Sergey Brin talking to... ??? XXX more or less on the same path: _"we like coding, we can't find stuff on internet, let's see if we can build something that help people to find stuff easy online. Worst case scenario we coded for a while. Ah! it woeks... people use it! we are cool. Ah! you want to advertise on Google? and you want to pay us!? of course for money we will let you do that!"_

Plenty of other entrepreneur had a similar path. They were doing stuff for the sake of it. That's what Steve Jobs refers to when he says follow you passion. That is different from saying _"do stuff to make money that involve what you are good"_.

These entrepreneurs were building products and they had no idea what the outcome would have been. We don't know how many other products they tried before receiving offers from clients.

The reality is, they were not only building products, they were building their career, their own life story. In those cases it happened to be a very rewarding life story. Building a life story, also called career path, is more important than building a product or finding a job. A life story is what will drive anyone for all his life. But this is not enough. A life story is the glue that will hold anyone together when a single product won't be enough any longer.

To confirm my statement, both Google and Apple, among many others, are run as a portfolio of products. There you have it, this is what I meant. These companies really are like holding companies with a bunch of subsidiaries. Extremely connected to each other.

Both these companies have the strengths to launch, test, develop, or cancel products continuously. They are run as Product Operations.

Some of these products are very expensive, some other are free, and often other are free for some and paid for others. some are physical, some are digital. They all cater to different needs. Yet they are all connected to each other, and share a common purpose.

Live like Google, means that I think everyone can be a little bit of portfolio of products. Maybe with one revenue stream, maybe more than one, but certainly with a number of products that all contribute to an overall result.

Start from ONE, and ONE only product until that proves to be useful to someone, and then build your portfolio.

So. If you are still reading, here is my conclusion: pick that ONE product, based on how much you know about it, and how much you feel you can evangelize on it. Have a strong opinion, and be sure it's right. _"Every home will have a personal computer in 5 years"_ is a pretty strong opinion, but it was damns right. And stick to that until it works. Over and over. 1 meeting at a time. After 1000 meetings you may not have a product or a market, but will have a life story. And that will lead you to places.
